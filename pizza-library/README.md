# Pizza Library

Attention pizza lovers! You have found your new favorite app. Pizza Library is the one-stop-shop for finding, creating, and saving your favorite pizzas. 

Pizza Library allows users to:
- Load preset data of "starter" pizzas
- Search through the list of pizzas
- Create your own new pizza to personalize the app via the New Pizza Form
- Sort pizzas alphabetically
- Favorite pizzas and also sort by favorites
- Delete a pizza when you're seeing too much clutter

# Getting Started

Pizza Library is built in React and uses a db.json file to render data from a server. To run the app locally, follow these steps.

1. Run `npm install`
2. Start up the server on **port 3001.** Run `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001` to force the server onto 3001 since the App is running on port 3000.

*(make sure you are cd'd into the `pizza-library` child folder of the `Pizza-library` directory from your terminal before running the next command)*

3. Run `npm start` - this will open the React app locally on port 3000.
4. If done correctly, you should see a page like the below.



5. If you are not seeing the pizza and magnifying glass icon, try installing `npm install react-icons --save`
